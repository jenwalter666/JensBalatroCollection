## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

**Fusion Jokers** is a mod that allows players to combine jokers into special powerful new **Fusion Jokers**!

When you have a fusable joker, pressing on it will show a **"fuse" button**. When you have the correct jokers, and enough money, you can combine the jokers into a powerful **Fusion**!
